## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Cwright-2/Cwright-2** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Hi, I'm Christopher Wright
- I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering
- I chose my major because I wanted to do somthing that allowed me to help others and do somthing I thiught was interesting.
- A fun fact about me is: I ran the Marathon in December of 2025
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to learn how to use C and C++ to create personal projects.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: A book I would reccomend is Sputnik Sweetheart by Hakari Murakami. This book made me realise that I actually enjoy reading.
